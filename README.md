# RealEstateAIgent âœ¨

A project I completed as part of my [Generative AI](https://www.udacity.com/course/generative-ai--nd608) course at Udacity.

## Explore the Project

Head over to the [Project Notebook](Project.ipynb) to see the code and results in action.

## Project setup

### OpenAI `base_url`

If you want to run the code yourself, you'll need to update the OpenAI `base_url`. Search for the respective cell in the notebook and either replace it with `https://api.openai.com/v1` or remove the parameter completely to use the default API endpoint.

```diff
# Configure OpenAI client
client = openai.OpenAI(
   api_key=api_key,
-  base_url="https://openai.vocareum.com/v1",
+  base_url="https://api.openai.com/v1",
)
```

### `listings.json`

For convenience, I've included a pre-generated `listings.json` file containing real estate listings. You can use this file instead of generating new listings using the AI model, as demonstrated in the notebook. The listings were originally generated by the AI model and used for testing purposes.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you open the notebook in Colab and want to use the `listings.json`,
> don't forget to upload them. ðŸ™‚

### `buyers.txt`

The `buyers.txt` file contains a set of imagined potential buyers, also generated by AI. You can use this file as test data in the notebook to simulate buyer interactions with the listings in `listings.json`.
